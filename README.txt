This is the (empty) template file for the Computer Graphics final
project.  You may use this either as a team of one (1) or a team of up to
three (3).

If you are a team of one (1), please use git to commit and push (back to your
github repository) as we have done all semester.

If you are a team of two (2) or three (3), everytime you enter this project you
need to:

        UPDATE (pull any changes by team members into your copy of the code)

        COMMIT (incorporate any changes into your code base)

        work on the code

        COMMIT (incorporate you recent changes into your code base)

        PUSH  (merge your code base into the shared repository

It is important to do these steps CONSISTENTLY; otherwise, you may have angry
team members.

All code should contain the names of all the team members.
